// Strongly Connected Components

// A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices.
// A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.

// We can find all strongly connected components in O(V+E) time using Kosarajuâ€™s Algorithm.

// Time Complexity: The Kosaraju's algorithm calls DFS, finds reverse of the graph and again calls DFS.
// DFS takes O(V+E) for a graph represented using adjacency list.
// Reversing a graph also takes O(V+E) time. For reversing the graph, we simple traverse all adjacency lists.
